# session - hash // it's key :lists - is an array - see `session[:lists] ||= []`. it also has keys :error, :success for flash messages
# session[:lists] << { name: list_name, todos: [] }

# list - hash with key :name a value of string, and key :todos which is an array. see `session[:lists] << { name: list_name, todos: [] } `

# TODO: - each todo item in a list is a hash itself, contained in the array value of list[:todos], so putting a to item into the array of todos is going to be: `list[:todos] << { name: params[:todo], completed: false }`
